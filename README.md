# LangChain

Developed an interactive tool for document-based conversations using LangChain.** This web application facilitates user interaction with uploaded documents, allowing users to ask questions and receive relevant responses based on the document content. 

**Key functionalities:**

* **Conversational Retrieval:** Leverages LangChain's retrieval capabilities to find relevant information within uploaded documents based on user queries.
* **Large Language Model Integration:** Integrates a powerful LLM (ChatOpenAI) to generate informative and contextually aware responses to user questions.
* **Optional Features:** Offers configurable options like compression, data flare (for advanced information retrieval), and moderation (for potentially risky text generation). 



* **Conversational AI:** Building systems that engage users in information retrieval tasks.
* **LangChain Framework:** Utilizing LangChain's components for building custom NLP pipelines.
* **Large Language Models:** Integrating LLMs for advanced natural language processing tasks.
